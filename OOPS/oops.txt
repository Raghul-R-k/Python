Our program around functions i.e Blocks of statements that manipulate data. This is called the procedure-oriented way of programming.
There is another way of organizing your program which is to combine data and functionality and wrap it inside something called an object . This is called as object oriented programming language.

OOP'S concept:
    ->Class
    ->object
    ->Polymorphism
    ->Encapsulation
    ->Inheritance 
    ->Data Abstraction

Class : 
    ->Class is a collection of objects
    ->A class is a blue print for how something should be defined.
    ->Classes define the functions called methods,which identify the behaviors that an object created from the class can perform with its data.
    

Objects:
    ->objects are anything that has properties and some behaviours
    ->properties of objects ->variables
    ->behaviours ->functions of the objects 
    ->the properties that all object have are defined in a method called __init__()
    ->__init__ sets the initial state of the object

Property() method 
    ->is a built-in-function
    ->allows us to create a special type of attribute called a property for a class
    ->to manage attribute acccess ,encapsulation and validation within a class
    ->The property() function can be used instead of the @Property decorator to achieve same functionality

    #Syntax :
    property (fget=None,fset=None,fdel=None,doc=None)
    fget->to get the value
    fset->to set the value
    fdel->to delete the attribute
    doc->string that serve as a documentation for the attribute
