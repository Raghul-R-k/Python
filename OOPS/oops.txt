Our program around functions i.e Blocks of statements that manipulate data. This is called the procedure-oriented way of programming.
There is another way of organizing your program which is to combine data and functionality and wrap it inside something called an object . This is called as object oriented programming language.

OOP'S concept:
    ->Class
    ->object
    ->Polymorphism
    ->Encapsulation
    ->Inheritance 
    ->Data Abstraction

Class : 
    ->Class is a collection of objects
    ->A class is a blue print for how something should be defined.
    ->Classes define the functions called methods,which identify the behaviors that an object created from the class can perform with its data.
    

Objects:
    ->objects are anything that has properties and some behaviours
    ->properties of objects ->variables
    ->behaviours ->functions of the objects 
    ->the properties that all object have are defined in a method called __init__()
    ->__init__ sets the initial state of the object
