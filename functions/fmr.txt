-> map, filter and reduce are paradigms of functional programming
-> map and filter com built-in with python(built in function)
-> reduce , need to be imported as it resides in the functool module

 -> Syntax
    filter(function,iterable)
        -> function : it tests if each element of a sequence true or not
        -> Sequence : which need to be filtered , it can be list sets, tuples or containers of any iterartions
-> Lambda function (Ananymous function) :
    -> Function without a name 
    -> this function can take any number of arguments but only one expression , which is evaluated and returned 
    -> Syntax : 
        -> lambda arguments : expression
