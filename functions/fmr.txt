-> map, filter and reduce are paradigms of functional programming
-> map and filter com built-in with python(built in function)
-> reduce , need to be imported as it resides in the functool module

 -> Syntax
    filter(function,iterable)
        -> function : it tests if each element of a sequence true or not
        -> Sequence : which need to be filtered , it can be list sets, tuples or containers of any iterartions
-> Lambda function (Ananymous function) :
    -> Function without a name 
    -> this function can take any number of arguments but only one expression , which is evaluated and returned 
    -> Syntax : 
        -> lambda arguments : expression

map() function : 
-> returns a map object(which is an iterator) of the results               
-> after applying the given function to each items of a given iterable(list,tuple etc)
-> or allows you to process and transform all the items in an iterable 
-> without using an explicit for loop a technique commonly known as mapping
        Syntax:
            -> map(function,iterable,[iterable1,iterable2,.....])
